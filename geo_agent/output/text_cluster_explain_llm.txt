High-Level Cluster Personas

Here is a breakdown of each cluster's defining profile:

    Cluster 0: Unique Connectivity, Low Tree Count

        Profile: This is the only cluster where tree_connectivity is 6.0. It has moderate fire and heat risk but a very low tree count (mean of 0.44).

        Persona: üå≥ Isolated Green Space. This might represent parks or areas that are internally well-connected but isolated from other green areas, with moderate environmental risks.

    Cluster 1: Low Fire Risk, Varied Tree Count

        Profile: This cluster is uniquely defined by a low and consistent fire risk (mean of 2.0). However, it has a highly variable tree count (mean of 49, std of 56), meaning it contains locations with both few and many trees.

        Persona: üå≤ Safe but Inconsistent Greenery. These are areas with minimal fire danger but no consistency in their tree population.

    Cluster 2: Highest Heat Risk

        Profile: This is the highest-risk cluster for heat (mean of 4.0). It also has very low fire risk but a high and variable tree count.

        Persona: üî• Urban Heat Island. Represents the hottest areas, likely dense urban zones with lots of pavement, despite having a significant number of trees.

    Clusters 3, 4, 5, 6: The High-Risk Groups

        Cluster 3 (Lowest Risk): Defined by the lowest possible flood and fire risk (both 1.0). It has moderate heat risk and a decent tree count.

        Cluster 4 (High Flood, Low Others): Defined by high flood risk (3.0) and the lowest possible fire and heat risk (both 1.0).

        Cluster 5 (High Flood, Medium Heat): Similar to Cluster 4 with high flood risk (3.0), but with a moderate heat risk (2.0) and the highest average tree count of this group.

        Cluster 6 (High Flood, High Heat): The most vulnerable of this group, with high flood risk (3.0) and high heat risk (3.0).

        Personas: These clusters seem to segment areas primarily by their combinations of high risk, likely representing different types of vulnerable zones (e.g., low-lying industrial areas vs. dense residential zones).

    Clusters 7, 9, 11: Barren Lands

        Profile: These three clusters are all characterized by an extremely low tree count (mean near 0). Their differentiation comes from their risk profiles.

        Cluster 7: Moderate flood risk (2.0), low fire/heat risk.

        Cluster 9: The safest barren areas, with the lowest possible risk across all three categories (1.0). This is the second-largest cluster.

        Cluster 11: Similar to Cluster 7, with moderate flood and heat risk (2.0) and low fire risk.

        Personas: üèúÔ∏è Paved & Barren. These are likely parking lots, industrial yards, or new developments with virtually no tree canopy.

    Clusters 8, 10, 12: Urban Forests

        Profile: These clusters have the highest and most consistent tree counts in the dataset (mean > 120). They are all low-risk areas.

        Cluster 8: The largest cluster by far. Very high tree count (mean 125) with low-to-moderate risk.

        Cluster 10: Similar to Cluster 8 but with the absolute lowest risk profile (all risks at 1.0).

        Cluster 12: A slightly lower tree count than 8 and 10, but still very high, with a moderate flood/heat risk profile.

        Personas: üå≥ Thriving Urban Canopies. These are the ideal green areas: leafy, low-risk neighborhoods or large, well-maintained parks.

    Clusters 13 & 14: High-Risk Green Spaces

        Profile: These clusters both have moderate-to-high heat risk (3.0) and low fire risk. They are differentiated by tree count.

        Cluster 13: High tree count (mean 105) combined with high heat risk.

        Cluster 14: Very low tree count (mean 4) combined with high heat risk.

        Personas: Cluster 13 is a Hot but Leafy area, while Cluster 14 is a Hot & Exposed area. This could represent the difference between a park surrounded by highways versus an open plaza.

Key Observations & Next Steps

    Dominant Features: The risk variables and tree_connectivity appear to be very strong drivers of the clustering, as many clusters have zero variance in these features. 
    tree_count_sum is the main differentiator for clusters that have similar risk profiles (e.g., comparing Cluster 8 vs. 7).

    Actionable Insights: This segmentation is very useful. For example, if you want to increase the tree canopy, you might target clusters like 7, 9, and 11. 
    If your goal is to mitigate urban heat, Cluster 2 is your top priority.

    Visualization: As an ML engineer, your next best step would be to visualize these clusters. 
    A 2D plot using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or UMAP could reveal how these clusters are separated in the feature space. 
    Plotting them on a map would give you the spatial distribution and confirm if these personas match real-world locations.
